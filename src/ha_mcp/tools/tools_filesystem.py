"""
Filesystem access tools for Home Assistant MCP Server.

This module provides tools for reading and managing files within the Home Assistant
configuration directory, enabling AI assistants to:
- Read configuration files, logs, and other allowed files
- List files in allowed directories
- Write/delete files in restricted directories (www/, themes/, custom_templates/)

**Dependency:** Requires the ha_mcp_tools custom component, added in HA via its
"HA-MCP File & YAML Tools" config entry (NOT the "HA-MCP Server" entry, which
starts a redundant in-process server). The tools will gracefully fail with
installation instructions if the component is not available.

Feature Flag: Set HAMCP_ENABLE_FILESYSTEM_TOOLS=true to enable these tools.

    cached probe and enforce ``MIN_COMPONENT_VERSION`` from
    ``caps.component_version`` (info shipped in 1.1.0, already past the floor).
    Caps alone no longer prove the SERVICES exist, though: since 2.1.0 the
    server entry also registers the WS surface (#2289), so ``info`` answers on
    a server-entry-only install too. Such a component reports the additive
    ``tools_services`` field (#2292) — but the caps snapshot is cached for the
    client's lifetime while config entries come and go at runtime, so the
    cached boolean is stale in BOTH directions: a pre-tools-entry ``False``
    would block these tools until a restart, and a pre-removal ``True`` would
    wave calls through to now-missing services and surface raw
    service-call failures instead of the actionable error. So when the field
    is present at all, ignore its cached value and consult the live service
    registry (``_probe_tools_services``), which is memoized for
    ``_LIVE_TOOLS_PROBE_TTL_S`` — one ``get_services()`` per window, not one
    per gated call. ``None`` (a pre-2.1.0 component) keeps the old implication,

    Caps-absent band: caps is None for a component in the 0.11.0-1.1.0 band
    (services, no info command) or an absent one, so the same live probe is the
    only signal available. It is the secondary case now — on a current

    identically. A no-services verdict raises the "File & YAML Tools entry not
    set up" error (``_raise_tools_entry_not_set_up``), not an
    install-the-component prompt — the entry-not-added state is the common
    cause (#1996).
